Need to make a prediction of some sort

Trining data = All FIFA qualification games
Test data = All FIFA Cup games

Three possible outcomes for each game
1) Home team wins
2) Away team wins
3) Draw

Work to be done:
clean data (decide what needs to be done with all the empty fields)
Find correlations between variables and outcomes
visualize data with correlations
determine data distribution
fit data to GLM with proper distribution model
make predictions
measure prediction accuracy
(tune model) *time permitting
